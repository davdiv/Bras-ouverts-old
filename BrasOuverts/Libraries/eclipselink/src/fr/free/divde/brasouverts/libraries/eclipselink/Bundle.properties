OpenIDE-Module-Long-Description=\
    The EclipseLink project's goal is to provide a complete persistence solution that is both comprehensive and universal. \
    It will run in any Java environment and read and write objects to virtually any type of data source, including relational databases, XML, or EIS systems. \
    EclipseLink will focus on providing leading edge support, including advanced feature extensions, for the dominant persistence standards for each target data source; Java Persistence API (JPA) for relational databases, Java API for XML Binding (JAXB) for XML, Java Connector Architecture (JCA) for EIS and other types of legacy systems, and Service Data Objects (SDO).
